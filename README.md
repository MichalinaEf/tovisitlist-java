# tovisitlist-java
It is application for travellers, there is so many places to visit in the world.

Sometimes we can see some wonderful place in the internet and we know that we would love to visit it!
It is also very ease to forget what was the name of this place, or where was it...

The aim of this application is to have all of them on the list.
It is possible to put them to one of the category: city, monument, natural spot.
If your goal is to visit places from the UNESCO list, or Wonders of the World and Natural Wonders of the World, you can tick it in this app.

This application has been written in Java language. 
I used here all basics of Java:
  - encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance;
  - control statements: decision making (if and switch) and loops;
  - communication with user by the help of Scanner.
